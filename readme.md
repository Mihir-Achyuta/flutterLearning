## mobileDevLearning

This repo is my code for Angela Yu's Flutter course where I learnt the basics of Flutter and how to combine it with Firebase and a tutorial app built with React Native on Frontend Masters.

## Installation

Just clone the repo and use your IDE(I used VScode) to open a subdirectory of this repository. You will be instructed by VScode to run pub get to get all the dependencies so that your workspace doesnt flood with errors.

Make sure you have installed the Flutter SDK and have and IDE that supports the Dart and Flutter plugins. For the react native app make sure to npm install all the packages in the package.json.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Mihir-Achyuta/mobileDevLearning.git
flutter pub get
```

## Example Usage

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Mihir-Achyuta/mobileDevLearning.git
cd Destini
flutter pub get
code .
flutter run
```

## What I Learnt

1. Widgets -> Dart OOP Concepts and language Quirks -> Calling API's -> Firebase Connect with Auth and Firestore -> Provider State Management
2. Adapting from React JS to React Native
